# SpaceX Falcon 9 Dataset Analysis
*******************************************



This project aims to analyze the SpaceX Falcon 9 dataset using various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The SpaceX Falcon 9 dataset contains information about Falcon 9 rocket launches, including attributes like launch success, mission details, and more. This analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, interactive visualizations, and the implementation of machine learning models.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the analysis.
- `visualizations/`: Interactive visualizations created using Folium and Plotly.
- `models/`: Implementation of machine learning models.
- `README.md`: Project overview, instructions, and information.

## Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the dataset, check for missing values, and gain initial insights into key features.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Enhance the dataset by creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

3. **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilize Folium and Plotly to create interactive visualizations showcasing launch success, geographical distribution, and more.

4. **Machine Learning Models**: Implement SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and KNN algorithms to predict launch success.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy scores and identify the most accurate model.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the Decision Tree model using GridsearchCV to achieve the best possible accuracy.

## Results

The analysis resulted in the following findings:
- SVM accuracy: 84%
- Logistic Regression accuracy: 83%
- Decision Tree accuracy: 87%
- KNN accuracy: 84%
- After hyperparameter tuning, Decision Tree achieved a maximum accuracy of 87%.
